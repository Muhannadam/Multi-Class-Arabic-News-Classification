# 📰 Arabic News Classifier & Summarizer (TF‑IDF + Logistic Regression + Groq LLM)

Welcome to our final project for **EMAI 641: Deep Learning**.

This project showcases an integrated NLP system capable of:

- Classifying Arabic news articles into predefined categories  
- Generating intelligent summaries  
- Suggesting concise and meaningful Arabic headlines  

The project uses **Allam‑2‑7B** through **Groq API** exclusively for generative tasks (summarization + title suggestion), while classification relies on classical ML models.

## 📚 Project Description

We developed an end-to-end Arabic news classification and summarization system using a hybrid of:

- **Classical Machine Learning** (TF‑IDF + Logistic Regression)
- **Generative AI** (Allam model via Groq API)

The system is fully optimized for **Arabic language processing**, supports **RTL layout**, and provides fast, accurate, and production-ready performance.

This project demonstrates practical applications of NLP in the Arabic domain, including:

- News platform automation  
- Content recommendation systems  
- Media monitoring  
- Journalism tools
